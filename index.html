          <p1>I started Brazilian Jiu Jitsu when I was about 12 years old. My uncle has been practicing for many years, and one day he invited my sisters and I,
              along with our father, to a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu class at his school. I was immediately hooked. I fell in love with the art, and continued to practice
              for many years. My father and I continued our training at Soca Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, a school run by ADCC Champion and world renowned BJJ Practitioner
              Alexandre "Soca" Freitas. It was there that I found a community, a family of people with the same passion for this art that I do. With this website,
              I hope to educate and encourage people to try out this sport for themselves.

      <h1> About Jiu Jitsu </h1>
      <body> 
        <p>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a martial art and combat sport based on ground fighting and submission holds. It focuses on the skill of taking an opponent 
          to the ground, controlling one's opponent, gaining a dominant position, and using a number of techniques to force them into submission via joint locks 
          or chokeholds. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu was first developed around 1920 by Brazilian brothers Carlos, Oswaldo, Gastão Jr., George, and Hélio Gracie, after 
          Carlos was taught traditional Kodokan judo by a travelling Japanese judoka, Mitsuyo Maeda, in 1917. Later they developed their own self-defense system 
          named Gracie Jiu-Jitsu.
